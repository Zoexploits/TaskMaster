# Task Master

TaskMaster is a web-based task management application that allows users to efficiently create, view, update, delete, and filter tasks. Users can also search for tasks based on specific keywords. This application leverages MongoDB for data storage and implements secure user authentication using JWT, bcrypt, and Express Validator. Additionally, it includes protection against XSS and SQL injection attacks.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of TaskMaster up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local or MongoDB Atlas for remote)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskMaster.git
    cd TaskMaster
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables (see below).

### Environment Variables

Set up the following variables in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret Key>
```

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **POST** `/users/signup` - Register a new user
- **POST** `/users/login` - Login with existing credentials

### Task Management

- **POST** `/tasks` - Create a new task
- **GET** `/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks (with filtering and search options)
- **GET** `/tasks/:id` - Retrieve a task by ID
- **PUT** `/tasks/:id` - Update a task by ID
- **DELETE** `/tasks/:id` - Delete a task by ID

#### Request and Response Examples

- **Create a Task**:
    - **POST** `/tasks`
    - **Body**:
      ```json
      {
        "title": "Complete project report",
        "description": "Finish the report for project XYZ",
        "dueDate": "2024-12-31",
        "priority": "high",
        "userId": "<User ID>"
      }
      ```

## Usage

### Run the Application

To run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```



### Testing

TaskMaster includes unit tests for key functions. Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

### Security

TaskMaster includes basic security features to ensure data integrity and protection against common attacks:

1. **Input Validation**: Uses `express-validator` to validate user inputs.
2. **XSS Protection**: Uses `sanitize-html` to prevent cross-site scripting.
3. **SQL Injection Protection**: MongoDB inherently protects against SQL injection, and user inputs are sanitized.
4. **Secure Headers**: Uses `helmet` to set secure HTTP headers.
